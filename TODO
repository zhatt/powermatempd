Click - toggle on and off
Press and turn - volume
Turn - change song

Turn on led when on turn off led when off.

There are two click cases.
	Down->Up toggle state.
	Down->Motion toggle volume.

When changing volume, set LED brightness to percent on.

Need a threshold of 5 units before deciding that motion is occuring.
	How do I reset this when button is not pressed?  Seperate abs position for up and down.

Do events need queued and sent asynchronously to mpd?
	Initially, we won't do that.

Handle position rollover.

Move cout to logs.
